                <p>I looked at all the headless systems on the market before going with Apollo system. 
                    I wanted the best build quality I could get and was not disappointed by the design, 
                    fit and function. Remco got straight back to me with any questions and shipping was fast. 
                    Love the miniature thrust bearings and all brass construction. Will definitely be using 
                    this system in the future.

                <h3>Ernie Taylor from ET Guitars - 2019</h3>
                <p>Here is our MIG FM6, testing new headless saddles hardware from our friends at
                    http://www.apollomusicparts.com/, an Australian company that designs and commissions 
                    the manufacture of headless and monorail bridge hardware. We will be pleased to work with 
                    Apollo parts in the future as hardware options on our guitars. We will do a more detailed 
                    video review in the future, but here are the main features and benefits we have found during 
                    prototyping.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Machined from solid brass, so good sustain and sturdiness</li>
                    <li>Good saddle travel range for intonation.</li>
                    <li>Metal ball bearing gasket at the thumb wheel, that allows smooth tuning and less contact wear.</li>
                    <li>ability to clamp the string in the saddle, to make the string double locked (head and bridge) and 
                        stable tuning.</li>
                    <li>machined brass saddle with a knife edge and good clearance, to provide a clear saddle contact point 
                        with no chance of string buzz.</li>
                    <li>They look cool and well finished!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks to our friend Remco at Apollo Music Parts for the hardware and we look forward to using Australian
                    parts in the near future.</p>
