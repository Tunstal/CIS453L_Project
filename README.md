# Apollo Music Parts

This project took the website [Apollo Music Parts](https://www.apollomusicparts.com/) and created a new website with a new design and using React to build it. One of the main features is that it uses a single-page application (SPA) methodology, which makes the website faster and more responsive. The redesign made the website more modern and user-friendly. The website is also more accessible and has a better user experience due to the new design and the use of React.
